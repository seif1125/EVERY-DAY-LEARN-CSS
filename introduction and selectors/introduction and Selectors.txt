Css Stands for cascading style sheets which used to give a style to
html elements as css is important as it gives us a lot of time efeeciency and modularity as 
we do not need to style each element seperatly eliminating redundancy



css is consist of numeber of declaration blocks where it is as the following

selector { properity:value; properity:value;   }

where a selector is the element ,id , class which i want to apply the styles on it 
and the declaration block is consist of properity as color and its value as redundancy

example 
          h1{color:red;}




we can use diffrent selectors as following

class selector: we can apply styles on all elements of a special class
example:
            .classname{color:red;}


id selector: apply styles on id 
example:
            #idname{color:red;}

group selector as we can specify special elements which have a classname to be only affected

example

div.classname{color:red;}


universal selector: use * to aplly changes on all elements
